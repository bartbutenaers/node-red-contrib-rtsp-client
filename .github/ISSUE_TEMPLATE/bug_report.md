Please take into account that I am ***NOT*** an FFmpeg specialist. 

So in case you have troubles with your audio or video (or other FFmpeg related stuff), please execute the following steps:
1. Start a discussion in the Node-RED [forum](https://discourse.nodered.org/) first, to explain your problem to the Node-RED community.  Of course it is best to mention me, to make sure I don't overlook it.
2. Afterwards create an issue in this Github repository, and add a link to the Discours discussion to it.
3. As soon as we found a solution with the help of the community, I will adjust the code or the readme page of this Github repository.
